   sudo passwd USER_NAME
   ```

### 7. **Conectando a máquina virtual com a máquina física via SSH**

#### 1. Configuração no VirtualBox:
   1. **Abra o VirtualBox** e selecione a máquina virtual que deseja conectar (neste caso, "Born2beroot").
   2. Vá para **Settings (Configurações)** → **Network (Rede)** → **Adapter 1 (Adaptador 1)**.
   3. **Mude o Attached to (Conectado a)** para "Bridged Adapter (Adaptador em ponte)". Isso permitirá que a VM use a mesma rede da máquina host.
   4. **Avance para "Advanced"** e clique em **Port Forwarding (Encaminhamento de porta)**.
   5. **Adicione uma nova regra**:
      - **Name:** “Rule 1”
      - **Protocol:** “TCP”
      - **Host IP:** Deixe em branco.
      - **Host Port:** “4242”
      - **Guest IP:** Deixe em branco.
      - **Guest Port:** “4242”

#### 2. Configuração na máquina real:
   1. ***OPCIONAL:*** Para garantir que o SSH está funcionando corretamente, você pode reiniciar o serviço de SSH na máquina virtual:
      ```bash
      sudo systemctl restart ssh
      sudo service sshd status
      ```
   2. **Na máquina virtual**: execute o seguinte comando para verificar o endereço IP da VM:
      ```bash
      ip address
      ```
      Anote o endereço IP que aparece após **inet**, como por exemplo: `inet 10.11.249.26`.
   
   3. **Na máquina física**:
      Abra o terminal da máquina física (host) e conecte-se à máquina virtual usando o comando `ssh`:
      ```bash
      ssh ivbatist@10.11.249.26 -p 4242
      ```
      - Substitua **ivbatist** pelo nome do usuário da sua máquina virtual.
      - O **10.11.249.26** é o IP da sua máquina virtual (o número será diferente dependendo da sua rede).
      - O **-p 4242** especifica a porta customizada que você configurou para o SSH.


### 8. **Creating and Configuring the Monitoring Script**
1. **Navigate to the directory**:
   First, navigate to the directory where the monitoring script will be created:
   ```bash
   cd /usr/local/bin
   ```

2. **Create and open the script file**:
   Create and open the monitoring script for editing. Use `vim` or `nano`:
   ```bash
   sudo vim monitoring.sh
   ```

3. **Insert the following script**:
   Copy and paste the script below into the `monitoring.sh` file:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Architecture
   arch=$(uname -a)
   
   # Physical CPUs
   cpuf=$(grep "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)
   
   # Virtual CPUs
   cpuv=$(grep "processor" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)
   
   # RAM
   ram_total=$(free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $2}')
   ram_use=$(free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $3}')
   ram_percent=$(free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {printf("%.2f"), $3/$2*100}')
   
   # Disk
   disk_total=$(df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{disk_t += $2} END {printf ("%.1fGb\n"), disk_t/1024}')
   disk_use=$(df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{disk_u += $3} END {print disk_u}')
   disk_percent=$(df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{disk_u += $3} {disk_t+= $2} END {printf("%d"), disk_u/disk_t*100}')
   
   # CPU Load
   cpul=$(vmstat 1 2 | tail -1 | awk '{printf $15}')
   cpu_op=$(expr 100 - $cpul)

#### 🧠 **Explanation of Commands:**

- **grep**: Searches for a pattern in a file and displays all lines that contain that pattern.
  - `-v`: Displays all lines that do NOT contain the pattern.

- **wc**: Used for counting lines, words, and characters in a file.
  - `-l`: Counts the number of lines in the file.

- **uname**: Displays information about the operating system.
  - `-a`: Shows all available system information.

- **df**: Shows the amount of available disk space on mounted filesystems.
  - `-h`: Displays sizes in a human-readable format.
  - `-m`: Displays sizes in megabytes.

- **vmstat**: Reports information about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, and CPU activity.
  
- **journalctl**: Retrieves logs from the system, including sudo command logs.

4. **Save and exit**:
   After pasting the script, save and exit the file.

5. **Make the script executable**:
   To ensure the script can be executed, run the following command to make it executable:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh
   ```

6. **Test the script**:
   You can run the script manually to verify that it works:
   ```bash
   sudo ./monitoring.sh
   ```

7. **Set up a cron job**:
   To run this script at regular intervals (every 10 minutes), edit the root crontab:
   ```bash
   sudo crontab -u root -e
   ```

8. **Add the cron job**:
   Add the following line to run the script every 10 minutes:
   ```bash
   */10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh
   ```

This script will monitor system architecture, CPU usage, memory, disk usage, TCP connections, and other details, and display the results every 10 minutes.





### 9. **Configuring Crontab**

#### 1. **Accessing the Crontab for the Root User**:
   - In the terminal, run the following command to open the **crontab** configuration file for the **root** user:
     ```bash
     sudo crontab -u root -e
     ```
   - This will open the crontab editor where you can schedule tasks for the root user.

#### 2. **Adding a New Scheduled Task**:
   - Add the following line at the end of the crontab file:
     ```bash
     */10 * * * * sleep $(who -b | awk -F: '{printf("%d"), $2%10}') && sh /home/ivbatist/monitoring.sh
     ```
   - This line does the following:
     - **`*/10 * * * *`**: Instructs the task to run every 10 minutes.
     - **`sleep $(who -b | awk -F: '{printf("%d"), $2%10}')`**: Adds a delay based on the system's last boot time to prevent all tasks from running at the exact same time.
     - **`sh /home/ivbatist/monitoring.sh`**: Specifies the command to execute, which in this case is the `monitoring.sh` script located at `/home/ivbatist/`.

#### 3. **Saving and Exiting the Crontab**:
   - After adding the line, save the file and exit the editor (usually using `:wq` in **vim** or **Ctrl + X** in **nano**).

#### 4. **Verifying the Task is Registered Correctly**:
   - To verify that the task has been successfully added to the **crontab**, run the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo crontab -l
     ```
   - This will display all scheduled tasks for the **root** user, and you should see the line you just added.

Now, every 10 minutes, the `monitoring.sh` script will be executed automatically as per the crontab configuration.

#### 🧠 **Crontab**: A scheduling utility in Unix-based systems that allows users to run scripts or commands at specified intervals. It works by using a cron daemon to periodically check the scheduled tasks and execute them.


### 10. **Closing UDP Port 68**

#### 1. **Checking if UDP Port 68 is Open**:
   - Run the following command to check if **UDP port 68** is open on your system:
     ```bash
     ss -tunlp
     ```
   - This command lists all open TCP/UDP ports and their associated processes. Look for port **68/UDP** to confirm if it's open.

#### 2. **Finding Your IP and Broadcast Address**:
   - Use the following command to display your IP address and other network details:
     ```bash
     ip address
     ```
   - Look for your interface (usually **eth0** or **enp0s3**) and note the **inet** IP (e.g., `10.11.249.26/16`) and **brd** (broadcast) address.

#### 3. **Checking Your Network Interface Details**:
   - Run this command to confirm your network interface details:
     ```bash
     ip a
     ```
   - This will give you the details of all network interfaces on your system.

#### 4. **Editing Network Configuration to Set a Static IP**:
   - Open the network configuration file for editing:
     ```bash
     sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
     ```
   - In the configuration file, locate the line that configures the interface to use **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

#### 5. **Changing DHCP to Static**:
   - Replace the **DHCP** setting with **static**, like this:
     ```bash
     iface eth0 inet static
         address {your_ip_address}
         netmask {your_netmask}
         gateway {your_broadcast_address}
     ```
   - Replace `{your_ip_address}` with your actual IP address (e.g., `10.11.249.26`), `{your_netmask}` with the appropriate netmask (e.g., `255.255.0.0`), and `{your_broadcast_address}` with the broadcast address (e.g., `10.11.255.255`).

#### 6. **Restarting Network Services**:
   - After making the changes, restart the network interface or the whole system for the changes to take effect:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart networking
     ```

#### 7. **Verifying the Port Status**:
   - Check again whether **UDP port 68** is closed by running:
     ```bash
     ss -tunlp
     ```

By following these steps, you will close **UDP port 68**, often associated with DHCP, and configure a static IP for your machine. This is particularly useful for securing your system and preventing unwanted network configuration changes.

#### 🧠 **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: A communication protocol used across the Internet that allows sending packets of data without requiring a connection, unlike TCP, making it faster but less reliable.
