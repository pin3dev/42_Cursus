  ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
   ```
* **Modify SSH Port:**
   - Locate the line:  
     `#Port 22`
   - **Uncomment** the line by removing the `#` and change it to:  
     `Port 4242`

6. **Disable Root Login via SSH:**
   - Find the line:  
     `#PermitRootLogin`
   - **Uncomment** it and change it to:  
     `PermitRootLogin no`

7. **Save the Changes** and close the editor.

8. **Edit the Client SSH Configuration** (optional):
   ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/ssh/ssh_config
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/ssh/ssh_config
   ```

9. **Modify SSH Port for Clients:**

#### üß† **Explanation of Commands:**

- **grep**: Searches for a pattern in a file and displays all lines that contain that pattern.
  - `-v`: Displays all lines that do NOT contain the pattern.

- **wc**: Used for counting lines, words, and characters in a file.
  - `-l`: Counts the number of lines in the file.

- **uname**: Displays information about the operating system.
  - `-a`: Shows all available system information.

- **df**: Shows the amount of available disk space on mounted filesystems.
  - `-h`: Displays sizes in a human-readable format.
  - `-m`: Displays sizes in megabytes.

- **vmstat**: Reports information about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, and CPU activity.
  
- **journalctl**: Retrieves logs from the system, including sudo command logs.

4. **Save and exit**:
   After pasting the script, save and exit the file.

5. **Make the script executable**:
   To ensure the script can be executed, run the following command to make it executable:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh
   ```

6. **Test the script**:
   You can run the script manually to verify that it works:
   ```bash
   sudo ./monitoring.sh
   ```

7. **Set up a cron job**:
   To run this script at regular intervals (every 10 minutes), edit the root crontab:
   ```bash
   sudo crontab -u root -e
   ```

8. **Add the cron job**:
   Add the following line to run the script every 10 minutes:
   ```bash
   */10 * * * * /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh
   ```

This script will monitor system architecture, CPU usage, memory, disk usage, TCP connections, and other details, and display the results every 10 minutes.





### 9. **Configuring Crontab**

#### 1. **Accessing the Crontab for the Root User**:
   - In the terminal, run the following command to open the **crontab** configuration file for the **root** user:
     ```bash
     sudo crontab -u root -e
     ```
   - This will open the crontab editor where you can schedule tasks for the root user.

#### 2. **Adding a New Scheduled Task**:
   - Add the following line at the end of the crontab file:
     ```bash
     */10 * * * * sleep $(who -b | awk -F: '{printf("%d"), $2%10}') && sh /home/ivbatist/monitoring.sh
     ```
   - This line does the following:
     - **`*/10 * * * *`**: Instructs the task to run every 10 minutes.
     - **`sleep $(who -b | awk -F: '{printf("%d"), $2%10}')`**: Adds a delay based on the system's last boot time to prevent all tasks from running at the exact same time.
     - **`sh /home/ivbatist/monitoring.sh`**: Specifies the command to execute, which in this case is the `monitoring.sh` script located at `/home/ivbatist/`.

#### 3. **Saving and Exiting the Crontab**:
   - After adding the line, save the file and exit the editor (usually using `:wq` in **vim** or **Ctrl + X** in **nano**).

#### 4. **Verifying the Task is Registered Correctly**:
   - To verify that the task has been successfully added to the **crontab**, run the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo crontab -l
     ```
   - This will display all scheduled tasks for the **root** user, and you should see the line you just added.

Now, every 10 minutes, the `monitoring.sh` script will be executed automatically as per the crontab configuration.

#### üß† **Crontab**: A scheduling utility in Unix-based systems that allows users to run scripts or commands at specified intervals. It works by using a cron daemon to periodically check the scheduled tasks and execute them.


### 10. **Closing UDP Port 68**

#### 1. **Checking if UDP Port 68 is Open**:
   - Run the following command to check if **UDP port 68** is open on your system:
     ```bash
     ss -tunlp
     ```
   - This command lists all open TCP/UDP ports and their associated processes. Look for port **68/UDP** to confirm if it's open.

#### 2. **Finding Your IP and Broadcast Address**:
   - Use the following command to display your IP address and other network details:
     ```bash
     ip address
     ```
   - Look for your interface (usually **eth0** or **enp0s3**) and note the **inet** IP (e.g., `10.11.249.26/16`) and **brd** (broadcast) address.

#### 3. **Checking Your Network Interface Details**:
   - Run this command to confirm your network interface details:
     ```bash
     ip a
     ```
   - This will give you the details of all network interfaces on your system.

#### 4. **Editing Network Configuration to Set a Static IP**:
   - Open the network configuration file for editing:
     ```bash
     sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
     ```
   - In the configuration file, locate the line that configures the interface to use **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

#### 5. **Changing DHCP to Static**:
   - Replace the **DHCP** setting with **static**, like this:
     ```bash
     iface eth0 inet static
         address {your_ip_address}
         netmask {your_netmask}
         gateway {your_broadcast_address}
     ```
   - Replace `{your_ip_address}` with your actual IP address (e.g., `10.11.249.26`), `{your_netmask}` with the appropriate netmask (e.g., `255.255.0.0`), and `{your_broadcast_address}` with the broadcast address (e.g., `10.11.255.255`).

#### 6. **Restarting Network Services**:
   - After making the changes, restart the network interface or the whole system for the changes to take effect:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart networking
     ```

#### 7. **Verifying the Port Status**:
   - Check again whether **UDP port 68** is closed by running:
     ```bash
     ss -tunlp
     ```

By following these steps, you will close **UDP port 68**, often associated with DHCP, and configure a static IP for your machine. This is particularly useful for securing your system and preventing unwanted network configuration changes.

#### üß† **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: A communication protocol used across the Internet that allows sending packets of data without requiring a connection, unlike TCP, making it faster but less reliable.
