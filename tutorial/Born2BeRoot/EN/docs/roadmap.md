   ```bash
   sudo mkdir /var/log/sudo
   ```
* Edit the Sudo security configuration file:
   ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/sudoers.d/sudo_config
   ```
* Insert the following configuration settings code into the file to enforce security policies for sudo access:
   ```bash
   Defaults  passwd_tries=3
   Defaults  badpass_message="YOUR ERROR MSG HERE"
   Defaults  logfile="/var/log/sudo/sudo_config"
   Defaults  log_input, log_output
   Defaults  iolog_dir="/var/log/sudo"
   Defaults  requiretty

   > ‚úíÔ∏è **secure_path**:  
    Defines the path for secure access to system binaries and prevents malicious programs from overriding important commands. 

* Save the changes and close the editor.
  
    > üí° Once you've added the configuration, save the file and exit the editor. This will apply the password policy and command logging for all sudo activities.
 

### 6. **Configuring Non-Admin Password Security Policy**

* Edit the Login configuration file `login.defs`:
   ```bash
   sudo vim /etc/login.defs
   ```
* **Locate and Modify Password Settings**:
  | BEFORE | AFTER |
  |--------|-------|

     ```  
     Option 2  
     ```bash
      password  requisite  pam_deny.so retry=3
     ``` 
* Add the password security rules to enforce strict password requirements:
   ```bash
   minlen=10
   ucredit=-1
   dcredit=-1
   lcredit=-1
   maxrepeat=3
   reject_username
   difok=7
   enforce_for_root

    Enforces these rules for the root user as well.  

* Update current user password:  
   Option 1
   ```bash
   passwd
   ```  
   Option 2
   ```bash
   sudo passwd USER_NAME
   ```

### 7. **Connecting Virtual Machine to Physical Machine via SSH**
   * Open VirtualBox and select the virtual machine you want to connect to, in this case, `Born2beroot`.
   * Go to `Settings`
   * Go to `Network`
   * Go to `Adapter 1`
   * Change the `Attached to` setting to `Bridged Adapter`
> üí° This will allow the VM to use the same network as the host machine.
   * Proceed to `Advanced`
   * Click on `Port Forwarding`
   * **Add a new rule**:
     | FIELD | VALUE |
     |--------|-------|

   > üí° Note the IP address that appears after **inet**, for example: `inet 10.11.249.26`.  
   * Open the terminal on the physical machine (host) and connect to the virtual machine:
      ```bash
      ssh youruser@10.11.249.26 -p 4242
      ```
   > üí° Replace `youruser` with the username of your virtual machine.  
   > üí° The `10.11.249.26` is the IP of your virtual machine (the number may vary depending on your network).  
   > üí° The `-p 4242` specifies the custom port you configured for SSH.  
     

### 8. **Monitoring Script**
* Navigate to the directory where the monitoring script will be created:
   ```bash
   cd /usr/local/bin
   ```

* Create and open the script file:
   ```bash
   sudo vim monitoring.sh
   ```

* Insert the following script:
   ```bash
   #!/bin/bash
   
   # Architecture
   arch=$(uname -a)
   
   # Physical CPUs
   cpuf=$(grep "physical id" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)
   
   # Virtual CPUs
   cpuv=$(grep "processor" /proc/cpuinfo | wc -l)
   
   # RAM
   ram_total=$(free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $2}')
   ram_use=$(free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {print $3}')
   ram_percent=$(free --mega | awk '$1 == "Mem:" {printf("%.2f"), $3/$2*100}')
   
   # Disk
   disk_total=$(df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{disk_t += $2} END {printf ("%.1fGb\n"), disk_t/1024}')
   disk_use=$(df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{disk_u += $3} END {print disk_u}')
   disk_percent=$(df -m | grep "/dev/" | grep -v "/boot" | awk '{disk_u += $3} {disk_t+= $2} END {printf("%d"), disk_u/disk_t*100}')
   
   # CPU Load
   cpul=$(vmstat 1 2 | tail -1 | awk '{printf $15}')
   cpu_op=$(expr 100 - $cpul)
   cpu_fin=$(printf "%.1f" $cpu_op)
   
   # Last Boot
   lb=$(who -b | awk '$1 == "system" {print $3 " " $4}')
   
   # LVM Use
   lvmu=$(if [ $(lsblk | grep "lvm" | wc -l) -gt 0 ]; then echo yes; else echo no; fi)
   
   # TCP Connections
   tcpc=$(ss -ta | grep ESTAB | wc -l)
   
   # Logged-in Users
   ulog=$(users | wc -w)
   
   # Network Information
   ip=$(hostname -I)
   mac=$(ip link | grep "link/ether" | awk '{print $2}')
   
   # Sudo Commands Executed
   cmnd=$(journalctl _COMM=sudo | grep COMMAND | wc -l)
   
   # Output the information
   wall "   Architecture: $arch
       CPU physical: $cpuf
       vCPU: $cpuv
       Memory Usage: $ram_use/${ram_total}MB ($ram_percent%)
       Disk Usage: $disk_use/${disk_total} ($disk_percent%)
       CPU load: $cpu_fin%
       Last boot: $lb
       LVM use: $lvmu
       Connections TCP: $tcpc ESTABLISHED
       User log: $ulog
       Network: IP $ip ($mac)
       Sudo: $cmnd cmd"
   ```
   
   #### Configuration Explanations:
   > ‚úíÔ∏è **grep**:  
    Searches for a pattern in a file and displays all lines that contain that pattern.  
      `-v`: Displays all lines that do NOT contain the pattern.  
   > ‚úíÔ∏è **wc**:  
    Used for counting lines, words, and characters in a file.  
      `-l`: Counts the number of lines in the file.  
   > ‚úíÔ∏è **uname**:  
    Displays information about the operating system.  
      `-a`: Shows all available system information.    
   > ‚úíÔ∏è **df**:  
    Shows the amount of available disk space on mounted filesystems.  
      `-h`: Displays sizes in a human-readable format.    
      `-m`: Displays sizes in megabytes.    
   > ‚úíÔ∏è **vmstat**:  
    Reports information about processes, memory, paging, block I/O, and CPU activity.  
   > ‚úíÔ∏è **journalctl**:  
    Retrieves logs from the system, including sudo command logs.  

   > üí° This script will monitor system architecture, CPU usage, memory, disk usage, TCP connections, and other details, and display the results every 10 minutes.  

* Save the changes and close the editor.

* Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/monitoring.sh
   ```

* Test the script manually to verify that it works:
   ```bash
   sudo ./monitoring.sh
   ```

### 9. **Configuring Crontab**

* Set up a cron job at regular intervals (every 10 minutes)**:
   ```bash
   sudo crontab -u root -e
   ```

* Add the cron job to run the script every 10 minutes, at the end of the crontab file:
   ```bash
   */10 * * * * sleep $(who -b | awk -F: '{printf("%d"), $2%10}') && sh /home/ivbatist/monitoring.sh
   ```

   #### Configuration Explanations:
   > ‚úíÔ∏è **`*/10 * * * *`**:  
    Instructs the task to run every 10 minutes.  
   > ‚úíÔ∏è **`sleep $(who -b | awk -F: '{printf("%d"), $2%10}')`**:  
    Adds a delay based on the system's last boot time to prevent all tasks from running at the exact same time.  
   > ‚úíÔ∏è **`sh /home/ivbatist/monitoring.sh`**:  
    Specifies the command to execute, which in this case is the `monitoring.sh` script located at `/home/ivbatist/`.  

* Save the changes and close the editor.


* Verify if the task is registered correctly:
     ```bash
     sudo crontab -l
     ```
   > üí° This will display all scheduled tasks for the **root** user, and you should see the line you just added.

   > üí° Now, every 10 minutes, the `monitoring.sh` script will be executed automatically as per the crontab configuration.

### 10. **Closing UDP Port 68**

* Check if UDP Port 68 is Open**:
     ```bash
     ss -tunlp
     ```
   > üí° This command lists all open TCP/UDP ports and their associated processes. Look for port **68/UDP** to confirm if it's open.

* Finding your IP and broadcast address:
     ```bash
     ip address
     ```
   > üí° Look for your interface (usually **eth0** or **enp0s3**) and note the **inet** IP (e.g., `10.11.249.26/16`) and **brd** (broadcast) address.

* Check your network interface details:
     ```bash
     ip a
     ```
   > üí° This will give you the details of all network interfaces on your system.

* Edit network configuration to set a static IP:
     ```bash
     sudo vim /etc/network/interfaces
     ```
   > üí° In the configuration file, locate the line that configures the interface to use **DHCP** (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol).

* **Modify DHCP to Static**:
  | BEFORE | AFTER |
  |--------|-------|
  | `iface eth0 inet DHCP` | `iface eth0 inet static` |
  | `address {your_ip_address}` | `address 10.11.249.26` |
  | `netmask {your_netmask}` | `netmask 255.255.0.0` |
  | `gateway {your_broadcast_address}` | `gateway 10.11.255.255` |

* Restart the network services:
     ```bash
     sudo systemctl restart networking
     ```

* Verify the port status, Check again whether `UDP port 68` is closed:
     ```bash
     ss -tunlp
     ```

   > üí° By following these steps, you will close **UDP port 68**, often associated with DHCP, and configure a static IP for your machine. This is particularly useful for securing your system and preventing unwanted network configuration changes.
